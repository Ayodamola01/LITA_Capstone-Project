## Overview of Capstone project
- This is a project given by the facilitator to put to test all that has been taught in the class.
- Therefore, this repository is to showcase the use of the apps(tools) listed above in achieving the instruction on the dataset.
- The project is into 2 phases, Sales data and Customer data. Both are to be thoroughly analysed.

- Here are the instructions given on Sales Data and Customer Data respectively
  
** Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store**
Summary: In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlights these findings.
Instructions:
### Excel:
- Initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
    - total sales by product.
    - region and month.
    - Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
    - Create any other interesting report
### SQL:
Hint â€“ You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and
validate your queries.
    - retrieve the total sales for each product category.
    - find the number of sales transactions in each region.
    - find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
    - calculate total revenue per product.
    - calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
    - find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
    - calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
    - identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
### Power BI:
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. 
  -  sales overview
  -  top-performing products
  -  regional breakdowns.

- Here are the analysis to the instruction given. Starting with SQL.
  select*from [Cleaned Sales data]
select product, sum(quantity*unitprice) as totalsales 
from [Cleaned Sales data]
group by Product
  
''' SQL
Select * from [Cleaned sales data]
