## Overview of Capstone project
- This is a project given by the facilitator to put tp test all that has been taught in the class.
- This project showcases the use of the apps(tools) listed above in achieving the instruction on the dataset.
- The project is into 2 phases, Sales data and Customer data.

- Here are the instructions given on Sales Data and Customer Data respectively
  
-** Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store**
Summary: In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlights these findings.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
- Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
total sales by product, region, and month.
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and
total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report
2. SQL:
Hint – You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and
validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
- retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- calculate total revenue per product.
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
3. Power BI:
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The
dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and
regional breakdowns.


**Project 2: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service**
Summary: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify
segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI
dashboard that presents your analysis.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
- Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
- Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular
subscription types.
- Create any other interesting reports.
2. SQL:
Hint – You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write
and validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
- retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
- find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
- find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
- calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
- find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- calculate total revenue by subscription type.
- find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
- find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
3. Power BI:
- Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments,
cancellations, and subscription trends. Include slicers for interactive analysis
