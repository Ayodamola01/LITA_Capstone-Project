## Overview of Capstone project
- This is a project given by the facilitator to put tp test all that has been taught in the class.
- This project showcases the use of the apps(tools) listed above in achieving the instruction on the dataset.
- The project is into 2 phases, Sales data and Customer data.

- Here is the instruction given on Sales Data
  
- Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
Summary: In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlights these findings.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
o Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
total sales by product, region, and month.
o Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and
total revenue by region.
o Create any other interesting report
2. SQL:
Hint â€“ You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and
validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
o retrieve the total sales for each product category.
o find the number of sales transactions in each region.
o find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
o calculate total revenue per product.
o calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
o find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
o calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
o identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
3. Power BI:
o Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The
dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and
regional breakdowns.
